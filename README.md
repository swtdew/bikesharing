# Bike-Sharing

## NYC CitiBike Program Overview
The analysis is performed based on NYC CitiBike Share program. The goal is to demonstrate how the bike share program works and the benefits of it. The bike-share program can be utilized to make the commute more convenient for people living in the city, and for travelers to enjoy every corner of the city.

The analysis of this Bikeshare project is to provide as many aspects as possible for a bike-sharing program to solidify a proposal to convince the investors that a program as such will be a popular lifestyle choice and therefore a great investment in the city of Des Moines.

## Results
Below are the visualizations created in a tableau story and descriptions alongside to demonstrate the data on the CitiBike Share program in NYC.

## Summary

Based on the analysis from above, there are differences among genders, types of riders, peak periods of bike share during the week, duration of the bike rides, and frequency of bikes being used.

Using the data from the analysis, the bike-share program can better target their intended audience. Also, to optimize the distribution of the bikes in different areas, two more graphs are created with station names listed when hovering over the circles in tableau to gather station information about the most popular trip starting points and most popular trip ending points. On the bike share user end, if the bike share app shares information about the busiest trip starting and ending stations, they can choose to avoid those stations to have a hassle-free experience retrieving or returning bikes.
